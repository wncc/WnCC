Boosting is a well known machine learning technique, we use simple weak classifiers in cascade fashion to form a strong classifier. It's extremely effective, facebook uses some version of this algorithm for detecting faces (99,9% accurate). Implement basic adaboost on simulated data, then for digit recognition. Again implementation in python using opencv and must follow blockwise execution and tutorial format.
