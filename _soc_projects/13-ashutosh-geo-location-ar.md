This project tries to explore navigation using Geolocation AR. 

<!--break-->

Problem Statement : Remember Pokemon GO? How about doing something similar but more useful? How about moving around with smartphones in hand looking around Augmented World. Geo-location AR has huge potential in navigation and assistance.

<!--break-->
### Rough Timeline: 

* Week 1 - Familiarization with Unity software and Vuforia SDK
* Week 2 - Development of simple GPS and Gyroscope reading script.

# Checkpoint 1 - Simple app to display GPS data and Gyroscope sensors readings.

* Week 3 - Add objects at a specified location (without gyroscopic control).
* Week 4 -  Move the added object according to the motion of camera (using gyroscope).

# Checkpoint 2 - To be able to add objects at specified Geo Location.

* Week 5 - Record GPS values from major points in insti and also take pictures of image targets for secondary identification.
* Week 6 - Use the previously built module to augment models at GPS locations of insti.

# Checkpoint 3 - Add secondary Image Target based recognition.

* Week 7 - Add secondary identification using captured Image Target pics.
* Week 8 - Documentation and Final.

# Checkpoint 4 -Combine GPS based detection and Image Target based detection. 
# Documentations and End.
