#### This project is mostly aimed towards people who want to excel in the sport of competitive programming.

<!--break-->

#### The agenda during the summers would be to get people acquainted with standard data structures and algorithms. Apart from this the project would require the mentees to give substantial time to practice problems on various online judges like Codeforces, Codechef, SPOJ etc.

#### Note : Mention your familiarity with C++ in the proposal. Also if you already practice on some online judge, do provide the link to your profile
