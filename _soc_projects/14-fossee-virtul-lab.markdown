A Virtual Laboratory is an online facility aimed at providing a laboratory experience to students. Unlike Simulation Virtual Labs, Remote Triggered Virtual Labs (RT labs for short) is that category of Virtual Labs which enables the student to access a real experimental setup, remotely. One such facility is available for a laboratory setup known as “Single Board Heater System”, SBHS for short.

 The SBHS RT lab can be accessed at http://vlabs.iitb.ac.in/sbhs/ To understand what is SBHS, see the spoken tutorial available [here](http://goo.gl/lYdhRi). If you want to quickly learn how to access SBHS RT labs click [here](http://goo.gl/vs5P9d). A good documentation on this is available [here](http://sbhs.fossee.in/downloads) under the “Documentation” section. The document contains a dedicated chapter which attempts to explain the Client-Server architecture.
