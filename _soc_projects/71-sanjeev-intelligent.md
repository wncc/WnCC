The project aims at creating agents which can figure patterns from huge datasets on its own even without any prior information on how or where to look for trends.

No. of mentees: 7 or 8

Pre-requisites:

- Very good at logic and mathematics
- Enthusiastic in Data Science & AI

Description:
So far, mankind has advanced in the field of Artificial Intelligence by designing algorithms which look for patterns. For example: An algorithm which looks for edges in an image.
	The chaos we are living in needs a lot more than the patterns we perceive.
	The project aims at creating agents which can figure patterns from huge datasets on its own even without any prior information on how or where to look for trends.
	A good example of such an agents is a child trying to learn to speak. The child figures out patterns by associating data received by its eyes and ears even without any external agent asking the child to look for correlation between the data.
