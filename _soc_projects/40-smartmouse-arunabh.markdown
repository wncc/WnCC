The aim of this project is to turn our smartphones into a wireless mouse -- and not just any wireless mouse, the smartest of them all. 

<!--break-->

### Week 0
 *  Set up OpenCV on android studio.
 *  Study OpenCV and relevant packages.  
 *  Make an app that takes a picture and converts it into black and white. This would set us up beautifully for further developing the algorithm and proceeding towards making a real life application.
 
<!--We initially start with figuring out ways to measure the distance glided by the phone, using the phone's camera and other sensors in it such as accelerometer and gyroscope. Main work will include extracting features out of images and using those predict the distance travelled by the phone using machine learning techniques. Though this is expected to be a fun project and inspire learning and curiosity but at the end we can hope for an android app which converts our smartphones into wireless mouses. And then using the power of our smartphones we can make it as much smarter as we want. 

Quite a bit work has already been done. You can find the source code and results till date over here - [https://github.com/Arunabh98/Local-localization](https://github.com/Arunabh98/Local-localization). 
Do have a look at the plots which show the correlation of distance to various features I have already extracted -- [https://github.com/Arunabh98/Local-localization/tree/master/Plots](https://github.com/Arunabh98/Local-localization/tree/master/Plots).-->
