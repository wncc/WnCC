To build intrusion detection system using statistical analysis and ml. 

<!--break-->
IDS detects presence of unwanted and malicious network packets on a network that may be generated by trojans, viruses, worms or network mappers. Here we try to implement an IDS using machine learning
<!--break-->

You can expect to learn about computer networks, security issues, socket programming, basics of ML and increase efficiency in coding


### Pre-requisites
 Basic C or C++ or Python

<!--break-->
