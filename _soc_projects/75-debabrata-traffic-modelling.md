This is a continuation of the project "3D road network rendering" completed in the last SoC. The next aim is to build a traffic flow modelling tool and visualize the congestion at various parts of the road network. 
<!--break-->

More details can be found on the project's repository - https://github.com/codejaeger/road-network-renderer

### New objectives:
1. Improve the traffic manager module to handle traffic better the intersections.
2. Add a basic UI for simulation of traffic flows and visualize congested points.
3. Increase the road network creation time from key points (requires some knowledge of graph algorithms)


### Tentative Project Timeline
