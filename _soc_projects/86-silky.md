Description:

Fascinated by the potential of Reinforcement Learning? Want to leverage this potential on the challenging game 2048? Want to explore how the convolution of Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning is turning out to be a game changer in the field of AI. Try out your hands on developing a superhuman AI to ace the game of 2048.

We will be developing an AI that can play the game 2048. The agent will be based on Deep Reinforcement Learning architecture Deep Q Network (DQN). We will also be developing our own game environment using Matplotlib or PyGame. We might as well use OpenAI Gym for the same.

It would require sound knowledge on Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning, modern deep learning frameworks like Pytorch or Tensorflow, Python programming.

The pre-requisites are Python Basics, Machine Learning and Artificial Neural Networks. These aren’t hard prerequisites, if you are willing to spend time during the break to get a firm hold on these aspects of the project.

PROPOSAL

We expect you to cover the following aspects in your proposal.
Previous knowledge in this domain
Any projects that you have worked on ML/DL/RL.
How much time per week would you be able to devote?
Are you willing to read up the relevant material in the break?
Why are you interested in this project?
