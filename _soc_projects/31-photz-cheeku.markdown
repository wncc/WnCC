A scientific computing project aimed at calculating redshifts of extra-galactic objects from photometric data.
<p>
    Redshifts caluclated from spectroscopic data is accurate but it is time expensive to measure the spectrum. There is a correlation between photometric data which is easier and faster to measure and the redshift which can be used to calculate <i>photometric</i> redshifts. We are currently trying to write a neural network in Keras to compute photometric z from photometric magnitudes.
