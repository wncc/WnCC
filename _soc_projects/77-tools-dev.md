Have you ever wondered what data science is? Or how you should get started with it? This project answers those questions by helping one start off with data science.

No. of mentees: 4-6

Description:
This project aims at learning basic data science approaches like data transformations and data mining. By the end of the project, you could expect to be comfortable with basic manipulations to data and perform a few data mining techniques. You would also gain basic knowledge of popular python libraries (including but not limited to pandas, numpy, matplotlib and scikit-learn). This project will involve application of these concepts to a project using Python (you are free to choose the project but definitely can get recommendations).

### Tentative Project Timeline
<!--break-->

|Week Number  | Tasks to be Completed|
|--- | --- | 
|**Phase 1**| Basic set up and learning basic data transformations |
|**Week 1**| Brushing up basics of python and do basic installations |
|**Week 2**|  Learn basic data transformations|
|**First goal (tentatively)**| apply a few transforms to a given dataset and plot the results| 
|**Phase 2**| Learning data mining with practical examples|
|**Week 3**| Learn regression and classification and apply the techniques to fit a model|
|**Week 4-5**| Learn data mining techniques like clustering, association et al|
|**Week 6**| Implement the tools learned to make a basic project|
