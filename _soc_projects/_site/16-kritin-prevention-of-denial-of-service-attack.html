<hr />

<p>We will be implementing rampart algorithm, for the prevention of denial of service attack. We will begin with socket programming in C++  and implement pop3 algorithm for email access. In case it gets completed real soon and easily, we will try to implement rampart in c++.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Prerequisites : Efficiency in c++, slight knowledge of networks and socket programming will help. May have to read a lot of theory so be prepared for that.</p>

<p>Mentor will conduct an interview for the selection of mentees.</p>
