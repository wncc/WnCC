<p>Augmented reality is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real-world are “augmented” by computer-generated perceptual information.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>This project aims to build a AR Chess app which lets users to play chess without actually having a chess board and pieces. The user can either print one of the available chess board image markers or define a new image target.</p>

<p>Google about Augmented Reality to know more about it.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Unity is an excellent Game Engine used to build stable and high end games. We will be using Unity for developing this project. For Augmented Reality in Unity, we are going to use Vuforia SDK.</p>

<p>It is compulsory to install Unity, and setup Vuforia and complete the tutorials given in the resource in order to be eligible for further consideration. You will be asked for apk of the tutorial app to prove your competenc</p>
