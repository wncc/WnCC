<p>The project involves exploring various implementations of Independent Component Analysis on sound/images and demonstrating through an ipython notebook.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>We explored two different approaches to the problem of separating sources of audio signals by minimizing the statistical dependence - fastICA and FOBI. A detailed explanation of the theory and the code can be found on the rendered notebook <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/riddhishb/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/Cocktail%20Party%20Problem/PCA_ICA_FOBI.ipynb">here</a>. You can download and use the code and dataset from the <a href="https://github.com/riddhishb/ipython-notebooks/tree/master/Cocktail%20Party%20Problem">repository</a>. The notebook can also be found on the official <a href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks#signal-and-sound-processing">iPython Wiki</a>.</p>
