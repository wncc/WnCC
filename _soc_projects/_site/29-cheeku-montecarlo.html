<p>This internship involves the implementation of a Monte Carlo Path Tracer.</p>

<h3 id="monte-carlo-path-tracing-renderer">Monte Carlo Path Tracing Renderer</h3>
<p>In this project, you will implement a Monte Carlo Path Tracer. A path tracer is a kind of renderer in computer graphics. A renderer is responsible for generating the image or the graphics that you see on your screen. Even this text that you are reading is displayed via a font renderer. Path tracers are often used for photorealistic rendering, which means generating an image indistinguishable from a photograph. At the end of the project, you can expect to have a code capable of producing such images.</p>

<p>As a primer, you should read Andrew Glassner’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1441550.An_Introduction_to_Ray_Tracing">Introduction to Ray Tracing</a></p>

<h3 id="secondary-learning-goals">Secondary Learning Goals</h3>
<p>Apart from learning about path tracers and rendering, you can expect to learn about the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Monte Carlo Sampling</li>
  <li>Basics of ImageMagick</li>
  <li>OpenMP Parallelization.</li>
</ul>

<!--break-->

<h3 id="repositories">Repositories</h3>
<p>The project will be done in groups of two. We will consider minor variations
in the raytracers, Swati (<a href="https://github.com/wncc/swati-rt">swati-rt</a>) and Revati (<a href="https://github.com/wncc/revati-rt">revati-rt</a>)</p>
