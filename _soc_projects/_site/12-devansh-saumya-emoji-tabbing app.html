<p>This project aims at making tabulation easy and accurate in tournamnets.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Problem Statement : Tabbing app is an initiative to create a platform for easier and accurate tabulation of scores and teams for national  and international debate tournaments.
It would majorly involve creating match ups for teams based on their performance and allocating them rooms and judges for all rounds of the tournament and update their scores accordingly to announce winners. The broad aim is to reduce human errors and the time taken to manually take care of scores by directly providing a link to participants and judges for the updation of scores without the involvement of organizers.</p>

<p>The technical aspects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The API Backend of the app, which is a RESTful API in Django. This project enforces very strict coding standards and testing routines, so you will essentially learn not only Python and Django, but software development as a whole.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will learn fairly advanced HTML, CSS and JavaScript if you are working on this.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will also learn a lot about relational databases and their real time applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If time permits, we can also make an android app for the same.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are not already familiar with these, you will also learn what REST is, how APIs function, writing tests and ensuring code coverage, what are the security issues and how they are fixed, authorization and authentication in a highly complex permissions model and working with relational databases.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
