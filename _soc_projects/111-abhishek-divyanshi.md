The project targets to build a music recommender system which takes in your picture and then predicts your mood and accordingly predicts a song for you.

<!--break-->

No. of mentees: 10-11

Pre-requisites: Enthusiasm and a positive learning attitude
Comfort with the concepts from CS101 and a little of Python is a plus but not mandatory


What all will be required to complete this project ?
To carry out this project we’ll use Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision and maybe some APIs and development tools too if time permits.

How do we wish to accomplish it ?
We’ll first build a Face Recognition and mood predictor model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and later integrate it with a music recommender system. If time permits, we’ll integrate this using the Spotify API to allow more variability in the selection of songs and finally deploy it as a web application.

Selection Procedure:
First filter through SoP and later can have an interview or a small assignment
