#### The project lies at the crossroad of computer vision and machine learning trying approaches to solve problem of facial recognition (and maybe detection).

<!--break-->

#### We will use various classification algorithms like nearest neighbours ,support vector machines, feed forward neural networks which would run over dimensionality reduction algorithms like Principal Component Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis.


<!--break-->

#### After their completion we would like to try one of the following ideas: 

<!--break-->

#### 1) Use AdaBoost to implement a simple Viola Jones face detection.

<!--break-->

#### 2) Work on specialized deep learning techniques like Siamese Networks for dimensionality reduction or simple convolutional neural networks for the classification task.

<!--break-->

#### Reading material and side study would include introductory machine learning as well as basic statistics from books or online lectures. 

<!--break-->

#### Apart from them we would also recommend reading some breakthrough papers. For example look at Turk's Paper on using Eigenfaces or the paper on FisherFaces.

<!--break-->

#### A student is expected to have interest in Machine Learning and ready to pick up new things on the go. Apart from this a strong hold over Linear Algebra would be helpful!
