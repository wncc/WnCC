#### This project is mostly aimed towards people who are interested in machine learning and involves the use of machine learning algorithms to identify the various music genres

<!--break-->

#### One of the things we, humans, are particularly good at is classifying songs. In just a few seconds we can tell whether we’re listening to Classical music, Rap, Blues or EDM. However, this task is one which computers have historically haven’t been able to solve well. We aim to develop a machine learning algorithm which automatically classifies a song into its correct genre.

<!--break-->

#### The mentee would be expected to work with cutting edge machine learning algorithms to improve the classification of genres. This would require exploratory data analysis, feature selection (which features are relevant towards identification of genres) and implementation of machine learning algorithms to best classify the data.

<!--break-->

#### Get familiarized with the basics of machine learning. One of the excellent resources to kick-off your machine learning journey would be this excellent course offered by Andrew Ng on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning "Coursera")

<!--break-->

#### Your proposal should include your experience with machine learning, programming in python (or any standard language) and other relevant projects. It should also include a rough timeline of what you aim to achieve at the end of 2 months.
