### Job Description
We are looking for a python developer with experience in GUI development. You will be working on a project that involves developing a GUI, for a chemical process simulator, in python using [kivy](https://kivy.org/). The work includes designing, developing and testing various GUI functionalities like menubars, taskbars, drag and drop, popups etc. This GUI will then be interfaced with [OpenModelica](https://openmodelica.org/), which will serve as a simulation engine for the GUI. The interface will be majorly based on making system calls from python using the [package os](https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html). Therefore, part of the work will be dedicated to the development of the above mentioned interface.
