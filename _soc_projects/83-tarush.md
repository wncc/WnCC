Learning competitive coding, starting from where CS101 left. Introduction to "Competitive" part of it. Optimising code and learning data structures and algorithms.

<!--break-->

No. of mentees: <= 3

Initially, mentees would focus on learning new ideas and algorithms. But eventually most of the time would be spent on implementing those algorithms using a suitable platform (preferrably codeforces) as a rating based approach helps to check track progress.

### Tentative Project Timeline
<!--break-->

|Week Number  | Tasks to be Completed|
|--- | --- | 
|**Week 0** | CPP and CODEFORCES : revising basic cpp, making a basic template, making an account on cf, exploring the platform, making a submission, reading a tutorial  |
|**Week 1** | Reading and practising algorithms like search, sort, simple greedy ideas |
|**Week 2** | NUMBER THEORY: prime, divisibility, exponentiation, sieve etc. |
|**Week 3** | ADVANCED DS: vector, map, unordered map, queue, stack, list, dequeue|
|**Week 4** | DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING: practising standard cases of dp and getting hands dirty on cf |
|**Week 5** | BASIC GRAPHS: trees (dfs, bfs), storing graphs, basic properties, distance algorithms  |
