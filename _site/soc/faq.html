    <meta name="description" content="Web and Coding Club is one of the biggest clubs of IIT Bombay. As a part of the Students' Technical Activities Body, we aim to provide a gateway for the people in our institute to join the coding community. We create a platform which allows students to gain assistance and mentorship to enhance their coding ability. Our aim is to propagate the enthusiasm for coding in the institute and especially amongst freshmen. We believe that every student here at IITB should have an opportunity to learn how to code and develop a passion for it. The secret of getting ahead is getting started and we aim to provide every student with the right start." />

<h3 style="font-weight: 900;">Where does SoC take place?</h3>
<p>Season of Code occurs entirely online; there is no requirement to travel as part of the program. Although it would be better if done from IIT-Bombay itself.
</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: 900;">When does SoC happen?</h3>
<p>Season of Code is scheduled to happen from 16th May to 16th July. These dates are tentative and may be a subject to change. The proposal portal however is now open and will close on 7th May.
</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: 900;">Do I get a room retention if I am doing SoC?</h3>
<p>No. Because it is not necessary to be in the insti for SoC. However, activities like ITSP, SURP etc do offer room retention.</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: 900;">Can I do ITSP/SURP and SoC together?</h3>
<p>It is possible to do one of ITSP/SURP along with SoC. However, bear in mind that it might get a little difficult since both the projects would demand time. If you're planning to go on a vacation for a considerable period, doing both might not be a good idea. SoC has a rigid two month time frame but it can be done from home, provided considerable amout of time is put in.
</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: 900;">What can I do to help spread the word about SoC?</h3>
<p>You can share the website link. Share the official facebook post and encourage your friends to pariticipate in it!
</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: 900;">Can I participate in SoC as both a mentor and a student?</h3>
<p>No. We want to make sure that each project and student receives sufficient attention, and we feel this could create a bad experience for those involved. Please choose whether participation as a mentor or a student is more appealing to you and plan to apply accordingly.
</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: 900;">What are the eligibility requirements for participation?</h3>
<p>You should be a student of IIT-Bombay. In addition to this, some projects might require additional programming experience upon which you will be judged by your proposal.
</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: 900;">What programming language(s) should I know to participate in SoC?</h3>
<p>The programming language you need to know depends on the project you are going select. Learning a new programming language is not a tough job. In the past people with CS 101 as their coding backgrounds have also done SoC. For learning new languages you can refer to <a href="http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki/index.php/The_Web_and_Coding_Club">our wiki</a>.
</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: 900;">How much time does SoC participation take?</h3>
<p>You are expected to spend around 25+ hours a week working on your project during the 2 month coding period.
</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: 900;">How do I apply for SoC as a student?</h3>
<p>To start off, fill the <a target="_balnk" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScF3u5o_D-6G4E8-jl5ftqDN27tLpnAmR5ThE81OKrMHuFzuQ/viewform">Padawan form</a> with details. Most projects require a proposal to be submitted containg details of what you plan to do. These details can be found on each project's page. If a proposal is not required for your project, fill "-" in the proposal field in the form. Note that you can submit the form whenever you want, before the deadline. The link to the proposal can be of a draft that you keep editin. On the deadline i.e. 7th May, we would download all proposals and consider them as final. Filling the proposal early may attract feedback from the respective project's mentor. You can also approach the mentor on your own for proposal feedback.
</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: 900;">What should the proposal contain?</h3>
<p>The proposal should have a brief explanation of what you've understood and in what way do you want to contribute to the project. You should sketch out a rough timeline describing a list of deliverables. You should also describe your coding background and your past experiences which may be relevant, in the proposal.
</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: 900;">Can I submit more than one proposal?</h3>
<p>Yes, you surely can. Just fill the <a target="_balnk" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScF3u5o_D-6G4E8-jl5ftqDN27tLpnAmR5ThE81OKrMHuFzuQ/viewform">Padawan form</a> multiple times with links to your proposals. But you'll be selected for only one project.
</p>	

<h3 style="font-weight: 900;">Can I mentor more than one project?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can. Just fill the <a target="_balnk" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd57osi_wuufUt9caLo5q3QFXNzjXBhcuaKtj2RTK5OG5JFfw/viewform">Master form</a> multiple times. Note that you would have to put in more time if you plan to mentor ultiple projects. Mentoring can take up a minimum of 4-5 hours per week for one project.
</p>	

<h3 style="font-weight: 900;">How should I contact the mentor?</h3>
<p>The contact details for mentors are also listed in the project page.
</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: 900;">Can a group submit a proposal together to work on a single project?</h3>
<p>No, a proposal is required to be submitted only by an individual. However, the mentor may then select a few students and form a group.
</p>


<h3 style="font-weight: 900;">Should I send proposals directly to the mentoring organizations?</h3>
<p>No only the proposals submitted through our portal, i.e. by submitting the <a target="_balnk" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScF3u5o_D-6G4E8-jl5ftqDN27tLpnAmR5ThE81OKrMHuFzuQ/viewform">Padawan form</a> will be considered valid.
</p>

<h3 style="font-weight: 900;">What if I have more questions?</h3>
<p>Feel free to ping <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mastermind.sarthak">Sarthak Khandelwal</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ydidwania">Yashvardhan Didwania</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000338522650">Abeen Bhattacharya</a> or any other WnCC Member. You can also directly message <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wncc.iitb/">WnCC</a>.
